#  🚀 Full-Stack Data Science Project
📌 Project Overview
This is an end-to-end Data Science project that covers the complete workflow:

✅ Data Collection → ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing → ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → ✅ Feature Engineering → ✅ Model Training & Evaluation → ✅ Model Deployment (Web App / API).

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world data science skills including data wrangling, visualization, machine learning model development, and deployment.

🏗️ Project Architecture

Data Source → Data Cleaning → EDA → Feature Engineering → ML Model → Evaluation → Deployment
Data Collection – from CSV/API/Database

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handle missing values, outliers

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualizations & insights

Feature Engineering – encoding, scaling, transformations

Model Building – train multiple ML models

Model Evaluation – metrics & comparison

Deployment – Flask/Streamlit web app or FastAPI


🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming: Python

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

Model Deployment: Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit

Version Control: Git & GitHub

📊 Dataset
Source: (CSV / API / SQL Database)

Rows & Columns: e.g., 50,000 rows × 12 columns

Key Features:

Column	Description
Feature 1	Meaning
Feature 2	Meaning

🔍 Steps & Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection
Loaded dataset from CSV/API/Database

Verified data integrity

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed missing values / imputed them

Converted data types

Handled outliers & duplicate rows

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate & Bivariate analysis

Correlation matrix & heatmap

Distribution plots & boxplots

4️⃣ Feature Engineering
Categorical encoding (Label, One-Hot Encoding)

Feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)

Created new derived features

5️⃣ Model Building
Split data into train & test sets

Trained multiple ML models:

Linear Regression / Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Selected the best-performing model

6️⃣ Model Evaluation
Used metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, RMSE, R² Score

Compared results & tuned hyperparameters

7️⃣ Model Deployment
Saved model using joblib/pickle

Built a Flask/Streamlit web app for user interaction

Created an API endpoint for predictions
